# JeneticsTSP

JeneticsTSP is a Java application that demonstrates the use of the Jenetics library to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a genetic algorithm.

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the `main` method in the `JeneticsTSP` class.
2. Click on the grid to select cities. Each click will mark a city with a black square.
3. Press the Space key to start the genetic algorithm and find the optimal route.
4. Press the 'R' key to reset and clear the grid.

## Key Features

- Allows users to select cities on a grid interface.
- Utilizes the Jenetics library to solve the TSP using a genetic algorithm.
- Supports resetting the grid and starting the algorithm with keyboard shortcuts.

## Dependencies

- Jenetics library for genetic algorithm implementation.
